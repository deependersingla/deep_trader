I am starting this file in middle of project because to keep track of why I am making changes and also I am working alone so this is more of also a friend to me for brain storming. Let's start:
a) The current problem with the project is that I can see deep_trader improving the reward function based on how average reward is increasing on test data. But that means nothing to me now because its very hard to see what decision deep_trader is making from standardized data. Currently I am thinking to implement a code which actually shows decision per episode and that too with real price. This will help me analyze episode in much better way. Let's get started on it and I don't feel version 0 of this will be difficult to implement. 
b) The above idea actually helped and showed me that the way I have implemented reward system its not correct because I am taking highest price of that particular time interval while buying and lowest while selling. In small interval like a minute its bound to make loss because of it. Even on big interval this will be bad. There are two solutions which coming to my mind
1) Take average of opening, closing , highest and lowest price and use that price for that particular minute. If time interval is greater than minute take average of first minutes and then use those minutes average to take time interval average.
2) Make a second network which main task is just to select time when to execute trading action based on continous stream of time-price data trader is receving. This will be a good system to implement above deep_trader.
I will first go with first now and mostly will implement 2 later above it. I think implementing both will be good idea.
c) I also need to update standardization of data and reward system to use actual pricing rather than normalized price.
